#### This is a <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/mcmo" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.com</a> project which uses full-stack JavaScript to accomplish the following objectives.

1.   I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
2.   I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
3.   I can remove stocks.
4.   I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock.
